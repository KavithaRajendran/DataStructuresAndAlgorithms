Assignment 1:
-------------

1. Implement selection sort on a single linked list. 

   a. Create  a single  linked list of 10 numbers in random order.

   b. Traverse the list and show the node values.

   c. Sort the linked list.  Sort it so that you exchange the nodes and not just the values.

   d. Traverse the list again to show the values in sorted order.

2. Write a recursive algorithm to do binary search in a sorted array.

    a. Create an array of 15 sorted numbers.  You may hard code the values in the main function.

    b. Implement the recursive binary search.

    c. run the program to search for a number in the list

    d. run the program to search for a number not in the list.

    e. Create an array of 16 numbers and repeat steps a-d
