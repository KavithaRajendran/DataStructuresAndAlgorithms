# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

Assignment 1:
-------------

1. Implement selection sort on a single linked list. 

   a. Create  a single  linked list of 10 numbers in random order.

   b. Traverse the list and show the node values.

   c. Sort the linked list.  Sort it so that you exchange the nodes and not just the values.

   d. Traverse the list again to show the values in sorted order.

2. Write a recursive algorithm to do binary search in a sorted array.

    a. Create an array of 15 sorted numbers.  You may hard code the values in the main function.

    b. Implement the recursive binary search.

    c. run the program to search for a number in the list

    d. run the program to search for a number not in the list.

    e. Create an array of 16 numbers and repeat steps a-d
   
 Assignment 2:
 -------------
 1. Write a program to delete a node from Binary search tree.

     you will first make a Binary search tree (we already did the algorithm in the class for insert a node into BST.

    a. You may hard code the values you insert into the BST. You must insert at least 15 values in random order

              (DO NOT INSERT VALUES IN SORTED ORDER).

    b. run the program to display the tree before deletion.  You will do in-order traverse to display the nodes of the tree.

    c. Delete a node in the tree.  The node should be a leaf node.  Run in-order traverse again after the delete.

     d. delete another node in the tree. This node must not be a leaf node.  Run in-order traverse again.  Also mention if you replaced by predecessor or successor node.   In PRedecessor or the successor you replace this IS a leaf node. Run in-order traversal again. 

    e. Repeat the above step (d) but this time the predecessor or the successor you replace with must NOT be a leaf node.


2. Write the program to do bubble sort.

    a. you may insert random numbers into the array and hard code the array.

    b. There must be at least 15 numbers in the array.

   c. Display the array before starting the sort.

    d. Display the array after EACH PASS.

     e. The final sorted numbers at the final pass will be displayed.
